Documentation of the Simple Request Format
2012-10-22  Lipu Fei

1. Description
The simple request format is very easy to use, the syntax of which can be
described as follows:
  1) The request content consists of an arbitrary number of parameter-value
     pairs that has the form
         "parameter-name:value;"
     each pair has a parameter name and a value, splitted by a ":" in between.
     Each parameter-value pair is splitted by a ";". It is optional whether you
     append a ";" at the end or not.

  2) Simple comments are available in this format. A line starts with a "#"
     is considered a comment line. Note that only comment lines are supported
     here. You cannot do things like this:
         "APP=/usr/bin/ffmpeg  # using ffmpeg as the application",
     but you can use this instead:
         # using ffmpeg as the application
         APP=/usr/bin/ffmpeg

  3) An example is as follow:
         APP=/usr/bin/ffmpeg;
         APP.PARAMS=-i a.avi -i b.avi -target ntsc-dvd
         out.mpg;

Note that it is recommended to use parameter names like "APP.PARAMS" and
"CONFIG.ARRIVAL". These parameter names a more readable.

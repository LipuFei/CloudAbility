ChangeLog for CloudScheduling project
==================================================


2012-10-18  Lipu Fei  Started this project.
==================================================
Changes:
1. A scheduling framework has been created seems fine so far.

Finished Works:
1. The scheduling framework has been simply tested.
2. The module org.cloudability.util.CloudConfig has been simply tested.

Todos:
1. Finish implementing the Job execution procedure. SSH modules in KOALA may be
   needed.
2. Create a more general job allocation policy framework for the scheduler.
3. Create a more general resouce provisioning policy framework.
4. Integrate the XML-RPC modules previous implemented into this project.
5. Integrate the request listening modules.
6. Design and implement a JSDL parser.

Notes:
1. The Job's execution procedure can first be implemented in a simplified way
   which can satisfy the needs of in4392 lab. Then to think of a more general
   way.
2. Implementing a flexible framework for resource provisioning policies seems
   to be very difficult and complicated. So far, this framework is sufficient
   for the in4392 lab.
3. JSDL parser can wait. It is better to design and create a simple job
   description file format for submitting job, which can be utilized for in4392
   lab.

==================================================
Fixes:
1. Job's equals() function was not correct.

Changes:
1. Implemented equals() for VMInstance.
2. Assigning a VM instance to a job is now moved from JobMonitor to the
   allocator. It is allocator's responsibilty to get a job and a VM instance.
3. A sort() has been implemented for JobQueue to sort the queue with a given
   comparator.
4. A base class of allocation policies has been implemented. A FCFSAllocator and
   a helper class FCFSJobComparator have been implemented.
5. Attribute arrivalTime has been added to Job.
6. Provisioner, a base class for provisioning policies has been implemented. A
   simple static provision policy has been implemented. 
7. The allocation and provisioning logic has been moved from Scheduler to
   Allocator.

Todos:
1. Add a finialization method for ResourceManager to stop the provisioning
   policy thread.
2. Integrate the Cloud Manipulators into this framework and complete the static
   provisioning policy with it.
3. Pofiler.
4. Integrate Request Handler.

==================================================
Changes:
1. A simple profiler has been added.
2. The stopping of provisioner has been added in the resource manager.
3. Client request handling modules have been added.
4. A simple request parser has been implemented.
5. Cloud broker has been added.

Todos:

README for CloudAbility

==============================

1. How to use
In order to run the tests, please follow the instructions below:

1) put the configuration in the CloudAbility folder "config/cloud.config", and
   then start the CloudAbility using "ant CloudAbility".
2) start the client using "ant CloudClient".

3) every time you want to submit a job, press ENTER in the client.

4) you will see some statistics in the CloudAbility console, like:
   [java] 305511 [Thread-6] DEBUG org.cloudability.scheduling.Scheduler  - VM#29678 has been selected.
   [java] 305511 [Thread-6] DEBUG org.cloudability.scheduling.Scheduler  - No jobs available, freeing VM#29678.
   [java] 306511 [Thread-6] INFO org.cloudability.scheduling.Scheduler  - Jobs in pending queue: 0.
   [java] 306512 [Thread-6] INFO org.cloudability.scheduling.Scheduler  - JobMonitors running: 2.
   [java] 306512 [Thread-6] INFO org.cloudability.scheduling.Scheduler  - VMInstances in resource pool: 5.
   [java] 306512 [Thread-6] INFO org.cloudability.scheduling.Scheduler  - VMAgents running: 0.

   If you just submitted a job, the #job-pending may probably be increased by 1
   if there is no available VMs.

5) Once you have finished submitting all the jobs, you can EXIT the CloudClient
   by CTRL+C. Then you can observe the statistics in the CloudAbility console to
   see if your jobs have all been finished (or failed).
   In order to do this, please check the #JobMonitors metric. This number
   indicates if there is any job currently running in the system.

6) After all your jobs have been finished, press ENTER and CloudAbility will
   finalize itself and store the statistics data in a file.

7) However, it is also possible to exit CloudAbility while there still are some
   jobs running. CloudAbility will first stop all of them, and then exit.
   Please use "onevm list" command to check if all VMs created by CloudAbility
   have been deleted. If not, there may probably be a bug. Please contact me
   with some details.

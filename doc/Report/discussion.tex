\subsection{Findings}
In this section we will discuss the findings of the experiment.

\paragraph{Makespan}
In Fig.~\ref{figure_jobmakespan} we can see that the static allocation
has the highest makespan, the rationale behind this, is that during
the peak usage in the sample workload, there will be jobs that will
have to wait a relatively long time due to the static nature of the
policy and due to the almost equally sized jobs and
\textsc{fcfs}-policy - the job which is added when the queue is largest
will also have the largest makespan.

What is interesting to see is that the SE-0 has higher makespan for
the 10- and 20ms mean intervals, but not for the 30ms mean interval.

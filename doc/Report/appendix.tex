\appendix[Time Sheets]
The table below shows the we have spent on the whole lab
exercise.

    \texttt{total-time}  & 120hrs \\
    \texttt{think-time}  & 10hrs \\
    \texttt{dev-time}    & 50hrs \\

The \texttt{wasted-time} mainly consists of the following parts:

\begin{itemize}
\item Trying to create a usable VM on \textsc{das-4}.
\item Debugging the system problems that have something to do with DAS-4.
\item Redoing experiments due to uncontrollable system failures.
\end{itemize}


\appendix[Feedback]

During our implementation and experiments, we find that it is very often to
get a \textsc{ssh} host key exception while our system trying to connect a VM using
\textsc{ssh}. This often happens and we've got several experiments influenced by this
that have high number of VM failures. Since our implementation is in Java,
we use third party \textsc{ssh} library. So we are not sure if this is caused by
the SSH library we use or the \textsc{das-4} system itself.

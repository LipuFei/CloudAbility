\appendix[Time Sheets]
The table below shows the we have spent on the whole lab
exercise.

The \texttt{wasted-time} mainly consists of the following parts:

\begin{itemize}
\item Trying to create a usable VM on \textsc{das-4}.
\item Debugging the system problems that have something to do with textsc{das-4}.
\item Redoing experiments due to uncontrollable system failures.
\end{itemize}


\appendix[Feedback]

During our implementation and experiments, we find that it is very
often to get a \textsc{ssh} host key exception while our system trying
to connect a VM using
\textsc{ssh}. This happens often and we've got several experiments influenced by this
that have a high number of VM failures. Since our implementation is in
Java, we use a third party \textsc{ssh} library. So we are not sure if
this is caused by the \textsc{ssh} library we use, or
the \textsc{das-4} system itself.

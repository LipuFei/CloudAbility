TODO: Remove this if you think it is not necessary.

The \texttt{wasted-time} mainly consists of the following parts:

\begin{itemize}
\item Trying to create a usable VM on DAS-4.
\item Debugging the system problems that have something to do with DAS-4.
\item Redoing experiments due to uncontrollable system failures.
\end{itemize}

TODO: Remove this if you think it is not necessary.

During our implementation and experiments, we find that it is very often to
get a SSH host key exception while our system trying to connect a VM using
SSH. This often happens and we've got several experiments influenced by this
that have high number of VM failures. Since our implementation is in Java,
we use third party SSH library. So we are not sure if this is caused by
the SSH library we use or the DAS-4 system itself.

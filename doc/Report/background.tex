The application will take \textsc{h264} formatted video files as input
and output them to \textsc{dvd}-video formatted files by making use of
an IaaS provider. End-users upload their \textsc{h264} formatted file
to a front-end server - which is running our application - which in
its turn makes a job for this file and sends it to a VM at the
IaaS-provider based on the chosen allocation-policy. Because 1 job can
fully utilize 1 VM considering its \textsc{CPU} intensive nature, the
allocation-policy considers a VM free for taking only if it has
no current job being run on it. New VMs will be spawned if the
provisioner considers there to be a shortage of free VMs. 

\paragraph{Requirements}
To make the proposed system a successor to the current system, our
solution should adhere to the following requirements to be able to
scale well for future workloads.

\begin{enumerate}[i]
\item The system should be automated for 1) The creation and
  provisioning of the VMs (see also \ref{req:elastic}) ) 2) The
  allocation of jobs to VMs.
\item \label{req:elastic}Should support elastic policies to scale for
  sudden demand without human intervention.
\item Keep statistics so we can analyse the system for the experiment
  and make better implementation choices for future work.
\item The system should the means to restart when an error occurs
  which is in our control e.g. a sudden shutdown of our server part.
\end{enumerate}
In the next section we will show how our system adheres to these
requirements.

In this report, we designed a system based on IaaS cloud platform for
processing \textsc{h.264} high resolution video file conversions using
\textsc{FFmpeg} and evaluated the its performances on \textsc{das-4}
OpenNebula. Benchmark tests show that the performance of a single VM
is good, but the overallocation of OpenNebula can cause significant
VM slowdown with a maximum of 3.64 in a relatively high load situation.
We also found that the VM allocation on \textsc{das-4} OpenNebula is
efficient, taking only about 10 seconds in average, however, the OS
booting up sequence requires about 50 seconds, which becomes the main
overhead of allocating a new VM.
The experiment results show that our \policysimpleelastic{}
provisioning policy is capable of processing small \textsc{h.264} input
file in a lightly loaded environment efficiently with an acceptable
increment in charged-costs.

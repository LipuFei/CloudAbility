CloudAbility
============

This is the project/Large lab for IN4392 Cloud Computing at the TUDelft 
University.

Setup
=====
=====

This project uses the DAS4 Cluster and its OpenNebula setup to create 
nodes(/VM's) on the fly for a scalable way to convert video files.

Aim
===
=== 

The aim of this project is to find a fitting solution to the general
problems in a scaling application, which are:
 - Provisioning; When are VM's needed to load-balance, when are they in overflow.
 - Schedular; Which job gets precedence (if there is such a notion).
 - Allocation; Which job gets allocated on which VM.
